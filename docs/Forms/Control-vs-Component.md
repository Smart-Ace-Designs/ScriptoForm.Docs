# Control vs. Component
- A component does not draw itself on the form, but a control draws itself on the form or on another control. Both the Components and the Controls can be dropped onto a design surface.
- Examples:
	- A Timer object is an example of a component
	- A Button object is an example of a control
- All controls are also components, but not all components are controls.
- In a ScriptoForm script, both controls and components are collectively instantiated in the [[Controls|Controls]] region.
