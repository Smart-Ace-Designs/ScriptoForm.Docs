# Header Region
The **Header**, designated by the use of PowerShell comment block and located at the very top of the script, is used to provide basic information about the ScriptoForm and usually includes the following information:
- Script name
- Script author
- Script description ("notes")

Unlike other sections, the **Header** section does not make use of a [region](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2018/03/22/organizing-powershell-code-regions.aspx) tag identifier.  However, for consistency purposes, the term "region" is used to categorize this section of code.
## Code Example
```Powershell
<#
============================================================================================================================
Script:
Author: 

Notes:

============================================================================================================================
#>
```
